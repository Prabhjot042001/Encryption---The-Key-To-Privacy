•	Used Java language with JFrame and Swing in netbeans to analyse and compare different variants of LSB (Least Significant Bit) modification techniques of the spatial domain.
•	The project aims to ensure secured transmission of data by implementing Image Steganography techniques like Significant Bit (LSB), Bit plane, Spiral Embedding, Metadata Manipulation, and much more.
•	Focused on analysis of image using inversion and different color maps, grayscale analysis of image, altering threshold of image (Histogram), providing metadata about the image, data chunks analysis of .PNG images and extraction of the appended Data (.PNG and .BMP files).
